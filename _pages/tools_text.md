Our experiment and PoC code, experiment harnesses, and data analysis
and visualization code are all available on
[Github](https://github.com/FPSG-UIUC/augury).

Broadly, the Github repo contains:

* [Code](https://github.com/FPSG-UIUC/augury#quick-and-dirty) for reproducing our main experiments

* [Code](https://github.com/FPSG-UIUC/augury#packaging-the-experiment-code)
  for thoroughly testing your machine for a pointer-chasing or indirection-based DMP

* [Code](https://github.com/FPSG-UIUC/augury#slh-poc)
  for running our out-of-bounds read and speculative load hardening
  (SLH) bypass PoCs
  
* [Code](https://github.com/FPSG-UIUC/augury#testing-validity-of-pointers-aslr-break-poc)
  for running our address space layout randomization (ASLR) break PoC
  
* [Code](https://github.com/FPSG-UIUC/augury#plotting-results-from-other-systems)
  for visualizing and analyzing the results from running our experiment code
